# All For One - Build

## Description:

The "All for One" Assignment is a comprehensive project that consolidates the mini API endpoints challenges into a 10-page web application. The focus of this assignment is to build out the front end using Tailwind CSS, creating a user-friendly interface for each API endpoint.

## Requirements:

### Page Structure:
Develop an 11-page application, with each page dedicated to a specific mini API endpoint challenge, and a home page with links to each page (except for Guess It). 

**Page order (does not have to be in this order):**
1. Say Hello
2. Adding
3. Asking Questions
4. Greater or Less
5. Madlib
6. Odd or Even
7. Reverse It (alphaNumeric)
8. Reverse It (numbersOnly)
9. Magic 8 Ball
10. Restaurant Picker
11. Home Page

### Input and Display:
- Implement user input fields on each page to gather information from the user relevant to the respective API endpoint.
- Display the information retrieved from the backend in a clear and organized manner on the same page.

### API Endpoint Pages:
Each page should correspond to one of the mini API endpoints, showcasing the unique functionality of that endpoint.

**Example: Restaurant Picker Page:**
- **Description**: Create a page where the user can input a restaurant category.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Collect user input for the restaurant category.
  - Use the backend API to fetch a random restaurant suggestion based on the provided category.
  - Display the restaurant suggestion prominently on the page.

### Consistency:
- Maintain a consistent design theme across all pages to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Things to Turn In:
- Front-end code (zipped)
- Peer review
- Links in comments
- GitHub repository
- Azure or Vercel deployment
- Figma design

## Be Creative and Have Fun!

# Review by: Aaron Robinson
### Overall Feedback: The page works as intended and meets the requirements of the assignment. Although, I would try and add data valdiation for the time on the asking questions page. Maybe number vaidation and checking is the number is a valid hour time(1-12). Same for ReverseIt(alhpabetic). I like that your .js files are concise and neat. Other than those nitpicks, good job
